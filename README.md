##Professional Experience
**ENPLAN**, Redding, California	April 2014—Current
Position: Cultural Resources Manager and Human Osteologist
As the cultural resources manager, I am responsible for facilitating with clients; media and public outreach efforts; collaborating with federal, state, and municipal agencies; project budgeting, scheduling and reporting; and data management. I have experience managing teams of up to 15 people.  I have extensive experience in this position in directing laboratory processing and preparation of material for scientific analysis.  In addition to my responsibilities as the cultural resources manager, I am also the human osteologist; as such, I am responsible for the identification, analysis, and reporting of human remains discovered in archaeological contexts.  As part of my role, I investigate palaeopathological evidence of disease in human remains.  I am also responsible for the collection, analysis, and generation of GIS data and map products related to cultural resources.  I have also had some experience with Python and SQL in this role.

**Ironbark Heritage and Environment**, Canberra, Australia	March 201—October 2013
Position: Archaeologist				
In my position with this company I had extensive experience in digital illustration (Adobe Illustrator, CAD), using GIS software (ESRI), and maintaining databases.  My position with this company involved both individual and team-based projects.  In this position I received extensive laboratory experience in processing materials for further scientific analysis, including C14 dating, macrobotanics, resin analysis, and human remains analysis.

**Bioarchaeology of Nubia Expedition**, Wadi Gaoud, Sudan	January 2016—March 2016
Position: Palaeopathologist
My role in this project was as a field supervisor in the excavation of human remains and subsequent palaeopathological analysis.  Palaeopathological information collected from this project will be used to further the understanding of disease presentation, mobility, and magnitude during the ancient Kerma Period of northern Sudan.

##RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**Graduate Student**, Durham University		September 2012—January 2014
Migration in Romano-London: Identification and Significance using Lead and Strontium Isotopes
Conducted independent research concerning the observable impact of human mobility to the population health profile of Roman London.  Research efforts included extensive literature reviews, laboratory extraction and analysis of lead and strontium isotopes from human teeth, the subsequent analysis of samples using an Atomic Mass Spectrometer, and the development of a database management system to record and store all collected health based information.

**Research Assistant** for Dr. G. King, Durham University	January 2013—May 2013
The ecology of disease: An innovative application of ELISA to test for seronegative spondyloarthropathies and their triggers in an archaeological context, funded by The Wolfson Foundation.
I assisted in bone sample selection, preparation, and collection for ELISA assay testing.  The aim of this project was to identify cases of seronegative spondyloarthropathies in an archaeological population using non-traditional methods.

**Research Assistant** for Drs. C. Roberts and R. Gowland	November 2012—May 2013
The relationship of health and stature in England from pre-history onward
I assisted in the collection and management of stature data from un/published reports.  The aim of this project is to examine changes in stature from the Neolithic-Early Modern Period in England in order to deduce changes in the quality of health over time.
